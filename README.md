# Pong-Game
 
To start the game, open the build folder. Run "Pong Game".exe and the game should bring up its own window.

From the main screen you can choose single player or multiplayer. If you choose single player, you can then choose a difficulty.

In single player you can press w to move up and s to move down.

In multiplayer, the left player can use w and s to move and the right player can use the up and down arrows.

Powerups will appear on the screen. If the ball hits them, they will do one the following for a short period of time:
	-Make one of the paddles larger
	-Make one of the paddles smaller
	-Speed up the ball
	-Slow down the ball
	-Make the ball change to a random direction

The first player to get three points wins the game. The points are then reset and a new game starts.

On the main screen, you can also choose to go to the stats screen. You can view your total stats and clear them if you want.
